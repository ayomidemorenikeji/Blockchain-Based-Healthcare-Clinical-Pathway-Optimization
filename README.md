# Blockchain-Based Healthcare Clinical Pathway Optimization

A comprehensive blockchain solution for managing and optimizing healthcare clinical pathways using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This system provides a decentralized platform for healthcare providers to:
- Verify and manage healthcare entities
- Define and track clinical care protocols
- Monitor patient progression through treatment pathways
- Measure clinical effectiveness and outcomes
- Optimize care delivery efficiency

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Provider Verification Contract (`provider-verification.clar`)
Manages healthcare provider registration and verification:
- Register new healthcare providers
- Verify provider credentials
- Track provider specialties and licenses
- Maintain verification status

### 2. Pathway Definition Contract (`pathway-definition.clar`)
Handles clinical pathway creation and management:
- Create standardized care protocols
- Define treatment steps and estimated durations
- Manage pathway activation status
- Link pathways to verified providers

### 3. Patient Tracking Contract (`patient-tracking.clar`)
Monitors patient progression through pathways:
- Start patients on specific pathways
- Track completion of individual steps
- Record step outcomes and durations
- Manage pathway completion status

### 4. Outcome Measurement Contract (`outcome-measurement.clar`)
Tracks clinical effectiveness and patient outcomes:
- Record patient outcome scores
- Track satisfaction and complications
- Calculate pathway success rates
- Maintain statistical data for analysis

### 5. Pathway Optimization Contract (`pathway-optimization.clar`)
Analyzes and improves care delivery efficiency:
- Generate optimization suggestions
- Identify bottlenecks in care pathways
- Create improved pathway versions
- Track performance improvements

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Verification**: Blockchain-based provider verification ensures trust and transparency
- **Standardized Protocols**: Consistent pathway definitions across healthcare networks
- **Real-time Tracking**: Live monitoring of patient progress through treatment protocols
- **Data-Driven Optimization**: Analytics-based improvements to care delivery
- **Immutable Records**: Permanent, tamper-proof healthcare data storage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain development environment
- Clarity smart contract deployment tools
- Node.js for testing framework

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd healthcare-pathway-blockchain
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Run tests:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm test
   \`\`\`

### Deployment

Deploy contracts to Stacks blockchain:
\`\`\`bash
# Deploy provider verification contract
clarinet deploy provider-verification

# Deploy pathway definition contract
clarinet deploy pathway-definition

# Deploy patient tracking contract
clarinet deploy patient-tracking

# Deploy outcome measurement contract
clarinet deploy outcome-measurement

# Deploy pathway optimization contract
clarinet deploy pathway-optimization
\`\`\`

## Usage Examples

### Register a Healthcare Provider
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .provider-verification register-provider
"Dr. Smith Medical Center"
"MD123456"
"Cardiology")
\`\`\`

### Create a Clinical Pathway
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .pathway-definition create-pathway
"Cardiac Rehabilitation"
"Post-surgery cardiac recovery protocol"
u1
(list "Initial Assessment" "Exercise Program" "Nutrition Counseling" "Follow-up")
u30)
\`\`\`

### Start Patient on Pathway
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .patient-tracking start-patient-pathway
"PATIENT001"
u1)
\`\`\`

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests using Vitest:

\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

Tests cover:
- Contract deployment and initialization
- Provider registration and verification
- Pathway creation and management
- Patient tracking functionality
- Outcome measurement and statistics
- Optimization analysis

## Security Considerations

- Provider verification required for pathway creation
- Patient data privacy through pseudonymization
- Immutable audit trail for all healthcare interactions
- Access control for sensitive operations
